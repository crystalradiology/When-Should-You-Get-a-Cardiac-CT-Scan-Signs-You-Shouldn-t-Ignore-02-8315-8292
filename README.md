At Crystal Radiology, we believe that early detection is key to preventing life-threatening conditions, especially those affecting the heart. Cardiac health can decline silently over time, but with the right tools, we can catch warning signs early and take the necessary steps to protect your well-being. One of the most powerful diagnostic tools available today is the best Cardiac CT Scans service — a non-invasive imaging technique that provides detailed insight into the structure and function of the heart.

Understanding When You May Need a Cardiac CT Scan

1. A Family History of Heart Disease
If heart disease runs in your family — especially if a close relative had a heart attack or coronary artery disease before the age of 55 (in men) or 65 (in women) — you may be at increased risk. Even in the absence of symptoms, a Cardiac CT scan can help detect early signs of plaque buildup or anatomical irregularities that could affect heart function. With a proactive scan at Crystal Radiology, you can stay ahead of your risks and receive guidance on how to reduce them.

2. Smoking or a History of Smoking
Smoking is one of the most significant modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. It damages the lining of the arteries, reduces oxygen in the blood, and increases the risk of clot formation — all of which can lead to heart attacks or strokes. If you are a current or former smoker, a Cardiac CT scan is an important step in evaluating your cardiovascular health and identifying signs of arterial damage or narrowing.

3. Other Risk Factors
Even if you don’t have a family history or smoke, you may still be at risk for heart disease. Individuals with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, or a sedentary lifestyle are all candidates for cardiac imaging. A CT coronary calcium score or CT coronary angiography may be recommended by your healthcare provider to evaluate plaque buildup or assess blood flow in your coronary arteries.

4. Symptoms or Warning Signs
If you’re experiencing chest pain, breathlessness, palpitations, dizziness, or unexplained fatigue, don’t ignore them. These could be warning signs of a heart condition requiring immediate attention. A Cardiac CT scan allows radiologists to examine the heart and arteries in detail to pinpoint the cause and support a quick, accurate diagnosis.

5. Age and Gender Considerations
While heart disease can affect people of all ages, men over 45 and women over 55 are generally at greater risk. Still, younger individuals with multiple risk factors should not be excluded from evaluation. At Crystal Radiology, we take a patient-centred approach to determine whether a Cardiac CT scan is appropriate, regardless of age or gender.

The Benefits of Cardiac CT Scans
Cardiac CT scans are extremely effective at identifying:

·         Coronary artery calcium levels

·         Blockages or narrowing in the arteries

·         Congenital heart abnormalities

·         Structural problems in the heart chambers or valves

The results help your doctor assess your risk of heart attack or other cardiac events, and make informed decisions about medications, lifestyle changes, or further interventions.

Risks and Limitations of CT Scans for Heart Health
At Crystal Radiology, we’re transparent about the benefits and limitations of imaging, so our patients are fully informed.

1. Radiation Exposure
CT scans involve exposure to low levels of ionising radiation. While the doses used are minimal, especially with modern equipment, repeated scans should only be performed when clinically necessary. At Crystal Radiology, we use low-dose CT technology to keep radiation exposure as low as reasonably achievable.

2. Contrast Dye Use
Some cardiac CT scans use iodine-based contrast dye to enhance the visibility of blood vessels and soft tissues. While generally safe, contrast dye may trigger allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. It’s important to inform our team if you’ve had any prior reactions to contrast agents or if you have impaired kidney function.

3. Not Suitable for All Conditions
Best Cardiac CT Scans service is excellent for assessing large coronary arteries, but may not detect microvascular disease affecting smaller vessels. Additionally, individuals with severe kidney issues or certain medical implants may not be eligible for contrast-based CT imaging.
